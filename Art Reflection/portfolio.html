"I hate you."
It's that one phrase we always say to each other. 
Every time I hear you laugh, talk, or even know 
the fact that you're breathing it makes me want 
to choke you but couldn't, cause that would be a crime. 

And now I hate it more. 
I hate it but not for the same reason as before.

I hate it when you laugh with other guys, 
make small talk with those lovely smiles, 
and breathe through someone's ears while whispering 
something that makes both of you giggle
even after the crowd you're afraid of. 

I hate it. 

I hate it cause it makes me smile, mad, and want to strangle someone. 
I hate how my heart would ache after I throw cussing at you like we used to and you seem fine. 
        
I hate it. 
I hate how you now ignore me.
I hate how you don't hate me anymore.
Not feeling anything, treating me like someone you don't know. 
        
I hate it. 
I hate it cause I can't do the same. 
I rather you hate me, than give those hate to someone else.

                <h2 id="poem1-title"> I fear, therefore I am.</h2>
                <pre id="poem1-verse" class="verse">

I fear that I currently feel fear. 
I have witnessed a lot of things.
Construct a lot of words.
Seen a lot of smiles.
Whispered a lot of giggles.

"I had witnessed almost everything."
Is what I always say,
But I can't. Not right now.
I simply can not fathom anything at the moment.

I hardly have the will to confront my own destruction.
I am barely human at this point of living.
I am...who am I?

What am I?

I fear. 

Oh, why do I fear? 
What do I fear?
How should I fear?

Must I go walk, run, 
be paralyzed,
or simply daze. 

What is this thing?
What must I say?

I have tears again, I fear.
I am losing hope again, I fear.
I am closing my doors again, I fear.
I had thoughts of ending me again, I fear.
I am losing myself, all over again. Forcefully. I fear.

But still, I write. I breathe. I fear. Yet I live.

                <pre id="poem1-verse" class="verse">
   
At night where I doze off,
My thoughts would fall off.
        
I would feel my skin,
shrinking through my bones.
        
My breath hitthing
As a water fall.
        
My thoughts lingering,
And end with vows.
        
Words of wisdom, encouragement
and assurance, was nothing to this all.
        
These drops of salty water, will not help
My shrinked skins that spoiled as I rot. 
        
It's just again, another night that I am dead till a sun was shown.

To Your True Self
You are my soul's mate
I find beauty in your heart
For you I love and adore
Your heart speaks a different language,one I can never ignore:
It speaks with your actions,your actions define your beautiful soul
It sings with your smile,your smile that can melt me whole
